This is a program that detects objects defined in a yolo model based on one or more classes/properties. 

This script is specifically tailored to detect one class.

Here is an example script to train the model using yolov8
yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data="C:/Users/user//model/data.yaml" epochs=30 imgsz=640 device=0 lr0=0.001 workers=8 cos_lr=True optimizer=AdamW mixup=0.1 lrf=0.01 perspective=0.0005 weight_decay=0.001 hsv_v=0.4 hsv_s=0.7 degrees=0.5 translate=0.1 hsv_h=0.015 scale=0.5 shear=0.1 mixup=0.1 mosaic=1.0 amp=True

This will then create a .pt file which you can turn into a torchscript file via formatscript.py.

To build the script make sure you have the following installed:
Visual Studio 17 2022
Libtorch
Cuda
Cmake
OpenCV
